## Introduction

This script provides a basic user account management system that allows users to sign up and log in. User information is stored in JSON files, and the script provides functionality to create, manage, and validate user accounts.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

## Usage

To use the script, follow the steps below:

### Signing Up

1. Run the script.
2. When prompted, enter your desired username. The username will be converted to lowercase.
3. If the username is already taken, you'll be prompted to log in instead.
4. Enter your desired password.
5. Re-enter your password to confirm.
6. Your user data, including username, password, balance, and powers, will be saved to a JSON file.

### Logging In

1. Run the script.
2. If you already have an account, enter 'y' when prompted. If not, enter 'n' to sign up.
3. Enter your username and password.
4. The script will verify your credentials against the stored JSON files.
5. If the credentials are correct, you'll be logged in and a 'current.json' file will be created with your data.
6. If the credentials are incorrect or the account does not exist, you'll be prompted to try again.
